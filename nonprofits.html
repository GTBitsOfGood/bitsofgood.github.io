								<h3>What is expected from you?</h3>
								<p>The most important thing from you is communication. This is especially important at the beginning of the process to ensure that your needs are clearly communicated to the project manager when determining the scope of the project. Beyond this, you should expect at least bi-weekly communication with your project manager to discuss progress and address any questions the development team may have. At the end of the semester we will host a showcase event for all the projects and invite you to be there. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>How long do projects last?</h3>
								<p>Nonprofits will work with a project manager to outline a deliverable that can be completed within the scope of the semester. If additional requests are made, the project will be continued into the next semester and a new deliverable will be determined.</p>
